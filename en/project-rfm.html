        <h2>üéØ Situation</h2>
        <p>
          An e-commerce store was facing a challenge in understanding its growing customer base. Marketing campaigns were generic and untargeted, leading to wasted budget and low ROI. The company urgently needed a scientific method to identify its most valuable customers and those who needed special attention.
        </p>
        
        <h2>üìù Task</h2>
        <p>
          The goal was to apply the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to analyze customer behavior and segment them into strategic groups. Based on this segmentation, the company could design personalized marketing campaigns for each segment, increasing their effectiveness and improving customer loyalty.
        </p>

        <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Action</h2>
        <p>
          To achieve this goal, I took the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Calculate RFM Metrics:</strong> Using DAX in Power BI, I calculated three key metrics for each customer:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Recency:</strong> Number of days since the last purchase.</li>
              <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Total number of purchases.</li>
              <li><strong>Monetary:</strong> Total amount spent by the customer.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Assign RFM Scores:</strong> I scored each customer on each metric from 1 to 4 (or 5) to create a combined RFM score.</li>
          <li><strong>Create Customer Segments:</strong> Based on the RFM scores, I created 11 dynamic customer segments, such as "Champions," "Loyal Customers," "At-Risk," and "Hibernating."</li>
          <li><strong>Design the Dashboard:</strong> I built an interactive dashboard that displays the distribution of customers across these segments and allows management to analyze the characteristics of each segment individually.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>üìà Result</h2>
        <p>
          This analysis provided valuable strategic insights and direct practical benefits:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Identifying Best Customers (Champions):</strong> The most valuable customers were identified, allowing the company to reward them with exclusive loyalty programs to ensure their retention.</li>
          <li><strong>Targeting Promising Customers (Potential Loyalists):</strong> Custom campaigns were designed to encourage this segment to increase their purchase frequency and turn them into loyal customers.</li>
          <li><strong>Reactivating At-Risk Customers:</strong> The analysis revealed a large segment of customers at risk of churning, prompting the company to launch proactive campaigns with special offers to re-engage them.</li>
          <li><strong>Improving Marketing ROI:</strong> By sending the right messages to the right customers, the company was able to significantly improve the effectiveness of its marketing campaigns.</li>
        </ul>
