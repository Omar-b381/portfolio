        <h2>üéØ Situation</h2><p>As one of the world's largest sports brands, Adidas has a vast amount of sales data from multiple sources (physical stores, outlets, online sales). The company needed to consolidate and analyze this data to get a comprehensive view of its product performance and determine optimal strategies to increase profits.</p>
        <h2>üìù Task</h2><p>My task was to analyze a detailed Adidas sales dataset to answer key business questions such as: What are the best-selling products? Which sales methods generate the highest revenue? How does sales performance differ between regions?</p>
        <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Action</h2><p>To achieve this, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that went through the following stages:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Examined the initial data to understand its structure and identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track, such as total sales, total profit, and units sold.</li>
          <li><strong>Dashboard Design:</strong> Created a clear user interface that displays key metrics at the top, with detailed charts for analyzing performance by product, region, sales method, and time period.</li>
          <li><strong>Profitability Analysis:</strong> Added analyses focusing on the "Operating Profit Margin" for each product, providing deeper insight than just looking at total sales.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>üìà Result</h2><p>The dashboard provided strategic insights that enabled Adidas to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Improve Inventory Management:</strong> By identifying the most profitable products, the company could optimize purchasing and inventory decisions to focus on higher-return items.</li>
          <li><strong>Direct Marketing Strategies:</strong> The analysis revealed that online sales were growing significantly, prompting the company to increase its investment in digital marketing channels.</li>
          <li><strong>Customize Regional Offers:</strong> Understanding the differences in customer preferences between regions allowed for the design of tailored marketing campaigns and product offerings for each area.</li>
        </ul>
