    "content": "<p>In the highly competitive world of e-commerce, success no longer depends on product quality alone, but on how well you understand your data. Data is the new oil, and its analysis is the key to sustainable growth. In this article, I will outline five practical and direct ways data analysis can help increase your e-commerce store's profits.</p><h2>1. Customer Segmentation</h2><p>Not all customers are the same. Using models like RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), you can segment your customers into strategic groups: Champions, Loyal Customers, At-Risk Customers, and others. This enables you to:</p><ul><li>Launch marketing campaigns tailored to each segment.</li><li>Offer exclusive deals to your most valuable customers to increase their loyalty.</li><li>Re-target inactive customers with irresistible offers.</li></ul><h2>2. Market Basket Analysis</h2><p>Ever wondered which products customers buy together? Market Basket Analysis answers this question. By understanding these relationships, you can:</p><ul><li>Display smart product recommendations ('You might also like...').</li><li>Create bundles and offers that increase the Average Order Value (AOV).</li><li>Optimize product page layouts to display related items.</li></ul><h2>3. Dynamic Pricing</h2><p>Instead of setting a fixed price, you can use data to dynamically adjust prices based on factors like demand, competitor pricing, time of day, and even user behavior. This doesn't always mean raising prices, but rather setting the optimal price that maximizes profit at any given moment.</p><h2>4. Inventory Forecasting</h2><p>Stockouts mean lost sales, and overstocking means tying up capital. Using historical sales data, you can build predictive models that forecast demand for each product, helping you manage your inventory efficiently and avoid both problems.</p><h2>5. Conversion Funnel Analysis</h2><p>Why do customers add products to the cart and then leave without purchasing? Analyzing the conversion funnel (from visiting the homepage to completing the payment) helps you identify weak points on your site. You might discover that the checkout process is complicated or that shipping costs are unclear. Fixing these issues can significantly increase your conversion rate.</p><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Data analysis is no longer a luxury but a necessity for the success of any e-commerce store. Starting to implement these strategies will give you a strong competitive edge and set you on the right path to achieving real, sustainable growth.</p><p><strong>Ready to get started? <a href='/en/contact/'>Contact me</a> to discuss how we can apply these solutions to your store.</strong></p>"

     "content": "<p>In the world of modern medicine, Artificial Intelligence and data analysis play a pivotal role in improving healthcare. One of the most important applications is heart disease prediction models, which help doctors detect the disease before it occurs. In this article, I'll explain in simple terms how a heart disease prediction model works.</p><h2>1. Collecting Medical Data</h2><p>The first step is to collect patient data from multiple sources, such as:</p><ul><li>Blood tests and cholesterol levels.</li><li>Blood pressure and heart rate.</li><li>Age, gender, and family history of heart disease.</li><li>Lifestyle (smoking, physical activity, diet).</li></ul><h2>2. Processing and Cleaning Data</h2><p>Medical data often contains missing or inaccurate information. Data analysts clean this data, remove outliers, and convert it into a format usable for statistical models or machine learning algorithms.</p><h2>3. Choosing the Right Algorithm</h2><p>Several algorithms can be used, such as:</p><ul><li>Logistic Regression.</li><li>Decision Trees.</li><li>Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.</li><li>Artificial Neural Networks for more complex cases.</li></ul><h2>4. Training the Model</h2><p>The data is split into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The model learns from the training data the relationship between health factors and the probability of developing heart disease.</p><h2>5. Prediction and Performance Evaluation</h2><p>After training, the model is used to make predictions on new data. Its accuracy is then evaluated using metrics like:</p><ul><li>Accuracy.</li><li>F1-Score.</li><li>ROC Curve and AUC.</li></ul><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>A heart disease prediction model is a powerful tool that aids in early prevention and improves treatment outcomes. Its success depends on the quality of the data and the precision of its design. Using these models can save lives and reduce healthcare costs.</p><p><strong>Interested in how we can build a custom model for you or your medical institution? <a href='/en/contact/'>Contact me</a> to get started.</strong></p>"

    "content": "<p>Often, as developers, we need to display data in a way that is natural and easy for users to understand. For example, instead of showing a file size as a large number like '15042934' bytes, it's better to display it as '14.3 MB'. This is where the <strong>Humanize</strong> library in Python comes in.</p><p>The Humanize library is a simple and effective tool for converting technical data (like numbers, dates, and sizes) into a human-readable format. In this article, we will review the most important functions of this library and how to use them.</p><h2>1. Installation</h2><p>Before you start, you must install the library. You can do this easily using 'pip':</p><pre><code class='language-bash'>pip install humanize</code></pre><h2>2. Formatting Large Numbers (intcomma)</h2><p>The <code>intcomma</code> function helps add thousand separators to large numbers, making them easier to read.</p><pre><code class='language-python'>import humanize\n\nnumber = 1234567\n\n# Without the library\nprint(f'Original number: {number}')\n\n# Using humanize.intcomma\nprint(f'Formatted number: {humanize.intcomma(number)}')</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>Original number: 1234567\nFormatted number: 1,234,567</code></pre><h2>3. Converting Numbers to Words (intword)</h2><p>The <code>intword</code> function converts very large numbers into a shortened format using words like 'million' or 'billion'.</p><pre><code class='language-python'>import humanize\n\nlarge_number = 1560000000\nsmall_number = 85000\n\nprint(f'Large number: {humanize.intword(large_number)}')\nprint(f'Small number: {humanize.intword(small_number)}')</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>Large number: 1.6 billion\nSmall number: 85.0 thousand</code></pre><h2>4. Displaying Relative Dates (naturalday and naturaltime)</h2><p>This is one of the library's most powerful features. It allows you to display the time difference between a specific date and the current time naturally.</p><ul><li><code>naturalday</code>: Displays the day relative to the current day (e.g., today, yesterday, tomorrow).</li><li><code>naturaltime</code>: Displays the time difference precisely (e.g., 5 minutes ago, in 2 hours).</li></ul><pre><code class='language-python'>import humanize\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nnow = datetime.now()\nyesterday = now - timedelta(days=1)\nfive_minutes_ago = now - timedelta(minutes=5)\n\nprint(f'Day display: {humanize.naturalday(yesterday)}')\nprint(f'Time display: {humanize.naturaltime(five_minutes_ago)}')</code></pre><p><strong>Output (will vary based on runtime):</strong></p><pre><code>Day display: yesterday\nTime display: 5 minutes ago</code></pre><h2>5. Formatting File Sizes (naturalsize)</h2><p>This function is very useful when dealing with file sizes. It converts a byte count into an understandable format (KB, MB, GB).</p><pre><code class='language-python'>import humanize\n\nfile_size_bytes = 14784512\n\nprint(f'File size: {humanize.naturalsize(file_size_bytes)}')\n\n# You can control the format (e.g., use the binary system)\nprint(f'File size (binary): {humanize.naturalsize(file_size_bytes, binary=True)}')</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>File size: 14.8 MB\nFile size (binary): 14.1 MiB</code></pre><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The Humanize library is an indispensable tool for any Python developer who wants to improve the user experience of their applications. With just a few lines of code, you can transform complex data into simple, elegant text that makes your application more professional and user-friendly.</p><p><strong>Want to explore other useful Python libraries? <a href='/en/blog/'>Browse the other articles</a> on the blog.</strong></p>"

    "content": "<h2>1. Query Mechanics</h2><p>Before executing any query, a connection to the MySQL server must be established. This process involves verifying the username and password, ensuring the server is running, and that the client application has the necessary permissions. Once the connection is established, queries can be sent for execution.</p><p>The basic steps for query execution are:</p><ul><li><strong>Connecting to the Server:</strong> Each connection to a MySQL server is identified by a unique ID upon first connection.</li><li><strong>Permission Check:</strong> The user must have permissions to execute the query and access the required data.</li><li><strong>Syntax Check:</strong> The query parser ensures the syntax is correct before execution.</li><li><strong>Query Optimizer:</strong> Responsible for determining the most efficient way to execute the query, deciding the order of table joins, selecting appropriate indexes, and creating an execution plan.</li><li><strong>Result Set:</strong> Once the query is executed, the results are returned in a table format containing the requested columns and rows.</li></ul><h2>2. The SELECT Clause</h2><p>This is the most important clause in SQL queries, as it specifies the columns to be displayed in the results.</p><ul><li>Select all columns using <code>*</code>.</li><li>Select specific columns by listing their names, separated by commas.</li><li>Add literal values, numbers, or strings.</li><li>Use mathematical expressions or built-in functions.</li><li>Add user-defined functions.</li><li>Assign aliases to columns using <code>AS</code> to improve clarity.</li><li>Remove duplicates using <code>DISTINCT</code>.</li></ul><h2>3. The FROM Clause</h2><p>Specifies the tables from which data is retrieved.</p><ul><li><strong>Permanent Tables:</strong> Created using <code>CREATE TABLE</code> and remain in the database.</li><li><strong>Derived Tables:</strong> Result from a subquery and are stored in memory.</li><li><strong>Temporary Tables:</strong> Store data temporarily and disappear at the end of the session.</li><li><strong>Views:</strong> Stored queries that act as virtual tables with no actual data.</li><li><strong>JOINs:</strong> Merge rows from multiple tables based on a common column.</li><li><strong>Table Aliases:</strong> To simplify queries, especially when joining multiple tables.</li></ul><h2>4. The WHERE Clause</h2><p>Used to filter rows based on specific conditions.</p><ul><li>Direct filtering of rows.</li><li>Using logical operators <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> to combine conditions.</li><li>Creating complex conditions using parentheses.</li></ul><h2>5. Grouping and Aggregation (GROUP BY & HAVING)</h2><p><code>GROUP BY</code> combines rows that have identical values in one or more columns, often used with aggregate functions like <code>COUNT()</code>, <code>SUM()</code>, and <code>AVG()</code>.</p><ul><li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> To analyze data within groups rather than individual rows.</li><li><strong>HAVING:</strong> To filter the resulting groups after aggregation, unlike WHERE, which operates on individual rows.</li></ul><h2>6. The ORDER BY Clause</h2><p>Used to sort the results in ascending (<code>ASC</code>) or descending (<code>DESC</code>) order.</p><ul><li>Specify sorting order by one or more columns.</li><li>Ability to sort by multiple columns.</li><li>Sorting using expressions or functions.</li></ul><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Mastering these clauses gives you the ability to write clearer and more efficient SQL queries, making data analysis and result extraction more accurate.</p>"

    "content": "<h2>Introduction: When Code Isn't Enough</h2><p>Every developer knows the feeling: after weeks of hard work, building complex algorithms, and solving tough problems, the project is finally ready. The code runs efficiently, and the results are fantastic. But when you upload it to GitHub, you write a simple title, a few lines in the README, and call it a day.</p><p>Herein lies the problem. <strong>A brilliant project with a weak README is like a masterpiece hidden in a dark basement; its value exists, but no one can see it.</strong> A README is not just documentation; it's your project's landing page, its marketer, and its tour guide. It's the bridge that connects your complex technical work to the outside world.</p><h2>Why Do Most Developers Write Bad READMEs?</h2><p>The reason is simple: we focus on 'how' the code works and forget to explain 'why' it matters. A good README doesn't just speak to other developers; it also speaks to:</p><ul><li><strong>Recruiters:</strong> Who want to understand the business value of your project in 30 seconds.</li><li><strong>Potential Collaborators:</strong> Who need to know the project's structure and how they can contribute.</li><li><strong>'Future You':</strong> Who will return to the project in 6 months and need to remember the reasoning behind every decision made.</li></ul><h2>The Solution: A Strategic Prompt to Build Your Project's Story</h2><p>To help you build this bridge, I've created a prompt designed to be a 'roadmap' for writing a professional README. This prompt doesn't just ask you to fill in the blanks; it forces you to think about your project from a strategic perspective.</p><h3>The Ultimate Prompt</h3><blockquote><p>You are an expert technical writer specializing in software project documentation. Your task is to write a README file for a software project in a clear, professional, and comprehensive manner. The file should be designed to be understood by a diverse audience, including developers, hiring managers, and non-technical stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Required README Elements:</strong></p><p><strong>Fundamentals:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Title:</strong> An engaging and descriptive title for the project.</li><li><strong>Table of Contents:</strong> For easy navigation.</li><li><strong>Project Description:</strong> A brief overview of the project and its main objectives.</li><li><strong>Problem It Solves:</strong> Clearly explain what problem or gap this project addresses.</li></ol><p><strong>Technical Details:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Tech Stack & Rationale:</b> A list of technologies, tools, and libraries used, with a brief explanation for choosing each one.</li><li><strong>The Process:</strong> Describe the main steps the project went through, from data collection (if any) to building the model or application. Describe important engineering decisions you made.</li><li><strong>Getting Started:</strong> A clear, step-by-step guide on how to install and run the project locally.</li></ol><p><strong>The Storytelling Layer:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Motivation:</strong> What inspired you to work on this specific problem?</li><li><strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong> Mention 1-2 major technical challenges you faced and how you overcame them. This demonstrates your problem-solving abilities.</li><li><strong>Outcomes & Impact:</strong> What does the final product look like? What are the key results of the analysis or the capabilities of the application?</li><li><strong>Limitations & Future Work:</strong> Acknowledge any known limitations in the project and the ideas you have for future development. This shows integrity and strategic thinking.</li><li><strong>Intended Use:</strong> Who is the target audience for this project? How can they benefit from it?</li><li><strong>Credits & License:</strong> Acknowledge any data sources or code you used, and specify the license type.</li></ol></blockquote><h3>How to Use the Prompt Effectively</h3><ol><li><strong>Gather Your Information First:</strong> Before using the prompt, prepare brief points for each of the required elements for your project.</li><li><strong>Start the Conversation with AI:</strong> Copy the prompt, then provide the project information you prepared.</li><li><strong>Treat it as a First Draft:</strong> The output you get from the AI tool is an excellent draft, not the final version. Review it, add your personal touch, and correct any details to reflect your true voice and expertise.</li></ol><hr><h3>Conclusion: Invest in Your Project's Front Page</h3><p>A professional README is not a luxury; it is a direct investment in your personal brand as a developer. It transforms your repository from a mere code archive into a living portfolio that tells the story of your skills and your ability to deliver results.</p>"

Starting a community saves you time and effort and focuses on what will add value to the business.</p><p>In this article, I will share with you a step-by-step guide to determining the start of any data analysis project professionally.</p><h2>1. Understand the goal before the data</h2><p>The most common mistake made by novice data analysts (and sometimes even those who write) is working directly on data before understanding the problem or the main question.</p><p><strong>Questions to address:</strong></p><ul><li>What is the goal of Analysis?</li><li>What innovation does the business owner or management want to leverage in the results?</li><li>What are the KPIs (performance indicators) that they are interested in knowing?</li></ul><p><strong>Practical example:</strong></p><p>If you own an electronics company, the question might be:</p><ul><li>\"Why is the conversion rate of visitors to customers low?\"</li><li>\"Which customers are most likely to leave the service?\"</li></ul><p>This understanding will determine the type of data you need a lot of, and the analysis method you will use.</p><h2>2. Data collection and preparation (data collection and preparation)</h2><p>This stage takes 60-70% of any data analysis project's time.</p><p>The simple reason: the actual numbers are not realistic, full of errors, and not coordinated.</p><p><strong>Steps Process:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> From data requirements, Excel files, APIs, or even web scraping.</li><li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong><ul><li>Dealing with Missing Values.</li><li>Dealing with Outliers.</li><li>Unifying Data (Dates, Currencies, Units of Measurement).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> If you have more than one data source, you need to combine them intelligently to get a complete picture.</li></ul><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>If you have customer contact centers, you might need more than sales data + customer location data + customer service data.</p><h2>3. Exploration and Descriptive Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA)</h2><p>After the data is complete, a deep emotional phase begins.</p><p><strong>Goal:</strong></p><ul><li>Identify Innovation (Trends).</li><li>Discover relationships between innovations.</li><li>Notice any anomalies in the data.</li></ul><p><strong>Possible tools to use:</strong></p><ul><li>Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).</li><li>Power BI or Tableau if you want a quick visual.</li></ul><p><strong>Useful example:</strong></p><p>If Cozmo is an electronics data store, you might discover that:</p><ul><li>The most active purchasing group is “Young adults 18-24”.</li><li>Purchase rate increases on weekends.</li><li>Average order value (AOV) is higher for customers who buy ads from Facebook than from Google.</li></ul><h2>4. Advanced Analysis (Advanced Analytics)</h2><p>After you've used the data and understood the basics, here's where you can influence its impact analysis.</p><p><strong>Types Analysis:</strong></p><ul><li>Statistical analysis: Hypothesis streams.</li><li>Predictive analysis (predictive modeling): Using machine learning (such as forecasting future sales).</li><li>Analytical (recommendation systems): Suggesting products or services to customers.</li></ul><p><strong>Useful example:</strong></p><p>If you work for a SaaS company, you could build a Churn Prediction model for customers who are likely to cancel their monthly subscription, to help the marketing team create personalized tools for them.</p><h2>5. Turning results into stories (data storytelling)</h2><p>One of the most important skills that distinguishes creative people who are just “programmers” is starting to tell the story behind the data.</p><p><strong>Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>Use visualizations (line, column, pie chart – wisely).</li><li>Minimize the technical details when explaining them to make them presentable.</li><li>Always relate results to the business goal. Basic.</li></ul><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>Instead of saying:</p><p>\"Logistic regression analysis showed that the probability of churn increases by 35% when the monthly discount rate is set below 3 times.\"</p><p>Say:</p><p>\"Customers who interact less than 3 times per month are 35% more likely to churn. If we focus on increasing the engagement rate to twice the purchase rate, we can significantly increase the customer success rate.</p><h2>6. Build a dashboard</h2><p>Analysis doesn't end with an Excel file or PDF report. Starting with an interactive dashboard makes it easier to sign up subscribers at any time.</p><p><strong>Common tools:</strong></p><ul><li>Power BI.</li><li>Dashboard.</li><li>Google Data Studio (free if you want it).</li></ul><p>The dashboard lets management track key performance indicators:</p><ul><li>Daily sales.</li><li>Customer adoption rate.</li><li>Business renewal rate.</li></ul><h2>7. (Recommendations).</li><li>Strategic actions.</li><li>Measuring results after implementation.</li></ul><p><strong>Practical example:</strong></p><p>Let's say that 20% of customers achieve 80% of the profit (Pareto rule), the analysis can be defined as:</p><p>\"Allocate loyalty campaigns (loyalty programs) to this segment.\"</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2><h3>What is a Subquery and Why Use It?</h3><p>A subquery is an SQL query nested inside another SQL query. It's also known as an inner query or nested query, while the query that contains it is called the outer query.</p><p>Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. They are executed before the outer query, and their results are passed to the outer query to complete the operation.</p><h3>Its Importance in Advanced Queries</h3><p>Subqueries offer several key benefits for writing advanced SQL queries:</p><ul><li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> They help avoid repeating complex logic in multiple places.</li><li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> They break down complex queries into understandable and manageable blocks.</li><li><strong>Flexible Filtering:</strong> They allow for dynamic data filtering based on the results of other queries.</li><li><strong>Complex Operations:</strong> They enable complex calculations or analyses by breaking the work into steps.</li></ul><hr><h2>Types of Subqueries with Detailed Explanations and Examples</h2><h3>Single-Row Subquery</h3><p>This type returns only one row as its result and is typically used with comparison operators like <code>=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;</code>.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Find the employee with the highest salary\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nWHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees);\n\n-- Find employees whose salary is greater than the average salary\nSELECT EmployeeName, Salary FROM Employees \nWHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);</code></pre><h3>Multiple-Row Subquery</h3><p>This type returns multiple rows and requires operators that can handle multiple values, such as <code>IN</code>, <code>ANY</code>, and <code>ALL</code>.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Using IN: Find employees in specific departments\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nWHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments \n                      WHERE Location = 'New York');\n\n-- Using ANY: Find products more expensive than any product in a specific category\nSELECT ProductName, Price FROM Products\nWHERE Price > ANY (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE Category = 'Electronics');\n\n-- Using ALL: Find products more expensive than all products in a specific category\nSELECT ProductName, Price FROM Products\nWHERE Price > ALL (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE Category = 'Books');</code></pre><h3>Multiple-Column Subquery</h3><p>This type returns more than one column, allowing for the comparison of multiple values simultaneously.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Find orders that match the lowest price for each product\nSELECT OrderID, ProductID, UnitPrice FROM OrderDetails\nWHERE (ProductID, UnitPrice) IN \n    (SELECT ProductID, MIN(UnitPrice) FROM OrderDetails \n     GROUP BY ProductID);\n\n-- Find employees who work in the same department and have the same job title\nSELECT * FROM Employees E1\nWHERE (DepartmentID, JobTitle) IN \n    (SELECT DepartmentID, JobTitle FROM Employees E2 \n     WHERE E1.EmployeeID != E2.EmployeeID);</code></pre><h3>Correlated vs. Non-Correlated Subquery</h3><h4>Non-Correlated Subquery</h4><p>A non-correlated subquery is executed independently of the outer query and does not depend on values from it.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Non-correlated query - executes only once\nSELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);</code></pre><h4>Correlated Subquery</h4><p>A correlated subquery depends on values from the outer query and is executed once for each row processed by the outer query.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Correlated query - executes for each employee\nSELECT e.EmployeeName, e.Salary, e.DepartmentID\nFROM Employees e\nWHERE e.Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) \n                  FROM Employees \n                  WHERE DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID);\n\n-- Another example: Find customers who have more than one order\nSELECT CustomerName FROM Customers C\nWHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Orders O \n              WHERE O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID \n              HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);</code></pre><h3>Nested Subqueries (Subquery within a Subquery)</h3><p>Subqueries can contain other subqueries, enabling the creation of complex logic.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Find products with a quantity greater than a specific product's quantity\nSELECT ProductName, Quantity FROM Products \nWHERE ProductID IN \n    (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails \n     WHERE Quantity > \n        (SELECT Quantity FROM OrderDetails \n         WHERE OrderDetailID = 10));\n\n-- A more complex example: Find employees in departments where the average salary is higher than the overall average salary\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nWHERE DepartmentID IN \n    (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Employees\n     GROUP BY DepartmentID\n     HAVING AVG(Salary) > \n        (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees));</code></pre><hr><h2>Where to Use Subqueries</h2><h3>In the SELECT Clause</h3><p>A subquery in the SELECT clause is used to create dynamically calculated columns.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Add a column with the total number of orders for each customer\nSELECT CustomerID, CustomerName,\n       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders O \n        WHERE O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID) AS TotalOrders\nFROM Customers C;\n\n-- Add a column with the highest price in the same category\nSELECT ProductName, Price, Category,\n       (SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Products P2 \n        WHERE P2.Category = P1.Category) AS MaxPriceInCategory\nFROM Products P1;</code></pre><h3>In the FROM Clause as a Derived Table</h3><p>A subquery in the FROM clause can be used to create a temporary, derived table.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Calculate the average purchase amount for each customer\nSELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, AvgPurchase\nFROM (\n    SELECT C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName,\n           ROUND(SUM(O.TotalAmount) / COUNT(O.OrderID), 2) AS AvgPurchase\n    FROM Customers C\n    INNER JOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID\n    GROUP BY C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName\n) AS CustomerStats\nWHERE AvgPurchase > 500;\n\n-- Create a monthly sales report\nSELECT Month, TotalSales, AvgOrderValue\nFROM (\n    SELECT MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month,\n           SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSales,\n           AVG(TotalAmount) AS AvgOrderValue\n    FROM Orders\n    WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2024\n    GROUP BY MONTH(OrderDate)\n) AS MonthlySales\nORDER BY Month;</code></pre><h3>In the WHERE Clause for Filtering</h3><p>This is the most common use case for subqueries.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Find customers who have not placed any orders\nSELECT CustomerName FROM Customers\nWHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID FROM Orders \n                        WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL);\n\n-- Find products that have never been ordered\nSELECT ProductName FROM Products\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM OrderDetails \n                           WHERE ProductID = Products.ProductID);\n\n-- Find orders with a total amount greater than the average for the same month\nSELECT OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount\nFROM Orders O1\nWHERE TotalAmount > (SELECT AVG(TotalAmount) FROM Orders O2\n                    WHERE MONTH(O1.OrderDate) = MONTH(O2.OrderDate)\n                    AND YEAR(O1.OrderDate) = YEAR(O2.OrderDate));</code></pre><h3>In the HAVING Clause with Group By</h3><p>Used with aggregation to filter groups based on complex conditions.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Find departments where the average salary is higher than the overall average salary\nSELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY DepartmentID\nHAVING AVG(Salary) > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);\n\n-- Find customers whose total purchases are higher than the average total purchase amount\nSELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalPurchases\nFROM Orders\nGROUP BY CustomerID\nHAVING SUM(TotalAmount) > (SELECT AVG(CustomerTotal) \n                          FROM (SELECT SUM(TotalAmount) AS CustomerTotal \n                               FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID) AS AvgCalc);</code></pre><h3>In UPDATE / DELETE Statements</h3><p>Subqueries are very useful for conditional update and delete operations.</p><h4>Practical UPDATE Examples:</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Update employee salaries based on department budget\nUPDATE Employees \nSET Salary = Salary * 1.1\nWHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments \n                      WHERE Budget > 100000);\n\n-- Update order status based on date\nUPDATE Orders \nSET Status = 'Expired'\nWHERE OrderDate < (SELECT DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY))\nAND Status = 'Pending';</code></pre><h4>Practical DELETE Examples:</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Delete old, delivered orders\nDELETE FROM Orders \nWHERE OrderDate < (SELECT DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 365 DAY))\nAND Status = 'Delivered';\n\n-- Delete customers who have never placed an order\nDELETE FROM Customers \nWHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID FROM Orders \n                        WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL);</code></pre><hr><h2>Subquery vs. JOIN</h2><h3>When to Use a Subquery vs. a JOIN</h3><h4>Use a JOIN when:</h4><ul><li>You need to combine data from multiple tables in the final result set.</li><li>You want better performance with large datasets.</li><li>The relationship between tables is clear and direct.</li></ul><h4>Use a Subquery when:</h4><ul><li>You need to filter data based on complex criteria.</li><li>You want more readable code for complex queries.</li><li>You need to perform sequential calculations or use dynamic criteria.</li></ul><h3>Practical Examples Showing the Differences</h3><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Example 1: Same result, two ways\n\n-- Using a Subquery\nSELECT CustomerName FROM Customers\nWHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders \n                    WHERE OrderDate >= '2024-01-01');\n\n-- Using a JOIN (usually faster)\nSELECT DISTINCT C.CustomerName \nFROM Customers C\nINNER JOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID\nWHERE O.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01';</code></pre><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Example 2: A case where a subquery is preferred\n\n-- Find products more expensive than their category's average price (clearer with a subquery)\nSELECT ProductName, Price, Category\nFROM Products P1\nWHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products P2 \n              WHERE P2.Category = P1.Category);\n\n-- With a JOIN (more complex and less intuitive)\nSELECT P1.ProductName, P1.Price, P1.Category\nFROM Products P1\nINNER JOIN (SELECT Category, AVG(Price) AS AvgPrice \n           FROM Products GROUP BY Category) P2\nON P1.Category = P2.Category\nWHERE P1.Price > P2.AvgPrice;</code></pre><hr><h2>Best Practices</h2><h3>Performance Optimization</h3><h4>Use EXISTS instead of IN</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Better performance\nSELECT CustomerName FROM Customers C\nWHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Orders O \n              WHERE O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID);\n\n-- Slower with large datasets\nSELECT CustomerName FROM Customers\nWHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);</code></pre><h4>Avoid Correlated Subqueries When Possible</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Slow: Correlated subquery\nSELECT ProductName FROM Products P\nWHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products \n              WHERE Category = P.Category);\n\n-- Faster: Non-correlated subquery with a JOIN\nSELECT P.ProductName \nFROM Products P\nINNER JOIN (SELECT Category, AVG(Price) AS AvgPrice \n           FROM Products GROUP BY Category) Avg\nON P.Category = Avg.Category\nWHERE P.Price > Avg.AvgPrice;</code></pre><h3>Reducing Complexity</h3><h4>Use CTEs for Complex Queries</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Instead of complex nested subqueries\nWITH HighValueCustomers AS (\n    SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent\n    FROM Orders\n    GROUP BY CustomerID\n    HAVING SUM(TotalAmount) > 10000\n),\nCustomerOrders AS (\n    SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount\n    FROM Orders\n    GROUP BY CustomerID\n)\nSELECT C.CustomerName, H.TotalSpent, O.OrderCount\nFROM Customers C\nINNER JOIN HighValueCustomers H ON C.CustomerID = H.CustomerID\nINNER JOIN CustomerOrders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID;</code></pre><h3>Notes on Indexing</h3><h4>Create Indexes on Columns Used in Subqueries</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Create indexes to improve subquery performance\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_customerid ON Orders(CustomerID);\nCREATE INDEX idx_employees_departmentid ON Employees(DepartmentID);</code></pre><h4>Monitor Execution Plans</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Use EXPLAIN to understand how the query is executed\nEXPLAIN SELECT CustomerName FROM Customers\nWHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders \n                    WHERE OrderDate >= '2024-01-01');</code></pre><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><h3>Summary of the Importance of Subqueries</h3><p>Subqueries are a powerful and flexible tool in SQL that enables developers to write complex queries in a structured and understandable way. Although JOINs may be faster in many cases, subqueries provide logical clarity and easier maintenance, especially when dealing with complex requirements or sequential calculations.</p><h3>Advice for Students and New Developers</h3><ul><li><strong>Start with the basics:</strong> Master simple subqueries before moving to complex ones.</li><li><strong>Understand the types:</strong> Know when to use correlated vs. non-correlated subqueries.</li><li><strong>Test performance:</strong> Always compare subqueries and JOINs and choose the most appropriate one.</li><li><strong>Use indexes:</strong> Ensure proper indexes are in place on the columns you use.</li><li><strong>Avoid over-complication:</strong> Use CTEs or break the query into steps when needed.</li><li><strong>Use EXPLAIN:</strong> To understand how your database executes your queries.</li></ul><p>Practical application is the best way to master subqueries.</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2><h3>What is a View in SQL?</h3><p>A View in SQL is a virtual table created based on a stored SQL query, acting as a window to display data from one or more tables. Unlike regular tables, a View does not physically store data; it dynamically retrieves data from the base tables each time it is queried.</p><p>A View can be treated just like a regular table for SELECT operations, and in some cases, for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations as well, subject to certain conditions.</p><h3>Why We Use Views: Simplifying Queries and Hiding Complexity</h3><p>Using Views in SQL provides several important benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Simplify Complex Queries</strong>: Complex JOINs and subqueries can be hidden behind a simple View that is easy to reuse repeatedly.</li><li><strong>Abstract Database Complexity</strong>: It provides a layer of abstraction between users and the actual table structure, allowing the database schema to be changed without affecting applications.</li><li><strong>Enhance Security</strong>: Views can be used to grant users access to specific parts of the data only, without giving them direct permissions on the base tables.</li><li><strong>Ensure Reusability and Consistency</strong>: It guarantees that the same query logic is used across different applications, reducing redundancy and improving maintenance.</li></ul><h3>Difference Between a View and a Standard Table</h3><table class=\"data-table\"><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>View</th><th>Table</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Physical Storage</strong></td><td>Does not physically store data</td><td>Physically stores data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Space Consumption</strong></td><td>Only stores the query definition</td><td>Consumes storage space for data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance</strong></td><td>The query is executed every time it is called</td><td>Direct access to stored data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Updates</strong></td><td>Automatically reflects changes in base tables</td><td>Requires direct updates</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Indexing</strong></td><td>Cannot be indexed (except for Materialized Views)</td><td>Can have indexes created on it</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2>Types of Views</h2><h3>Simple vs. Complex Views</h3><h4>Simple View</h4><p>A Simple View is based on only one table and does not contain aggregate functions, GROUP BY, or JOINs.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Create a Simple View for employees in a specific department\nCREATE VIEW IT_Employees AS\nSELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary, HireDate\nFROM Employees\nWHERE DepartmentID = 1;\n\n-- Using the View\nSELECT * FROM IT_Employees\nWHERE Salary > 50000;</code></pre><h4>Complex View</h4><p>A Complex View can be based on multiple tables and can contain JOINs, aggregate functions, or data grouping.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Create a Complex View that joins information from multiple tables\nCREATE VIEW Employee_Department_Summary AS\nSELECT \n    D.DepartmentName,\n    COUNT(E.EmployeeID) AS EmployeeCount,\n    AVG(E.Salary) AS AverageSalary\nFROM Departments D\nLEFT JOIN Employees E ON D.DepartmentID = E.DepartmentID\nGROUP BY D.DepartmentID, D.DepartmentName;\n\n-- Using the View\nSELECT * FROM Employee_Department_Summary\nWHERE EmployeeCount > 5;</code></pre><h3>Read-only vs. Updatable Views</h3><h4>Read-only View</h4><p>This type of View does not allow INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. This typically occurs when the view contains aggregate functions, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, or JOINs.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- A read-only View due to aggregate functions\nCREATE VIEW Sales_Summary AS\nSELECT \n    ProductCategory,\n    COUNT(*) AS TotalSales,\n    SUM(SaleAmount) AS TotalRevenue\nFROM Sales\nGROUP BY ProductCategory;\n\n-- This View is for reading only\n-- INSERT INTO Sales_Summary VALUES(...); -- This will fail</code></pre><h4>Updatable View</h4><p>Updatable Views allow INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. They must generally be based on a single table and not contain aggregate functions or DISTINCT.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Create an Updatable View for active products\nCREATE VIEW Active_Products AS\nSELECT ProductID, ProductName, Price, CategoryID\nFROM Products\nWHERE IsActive = 1;\n\n-- DML operations are now allowed through the view\nUPDATE Active_Products \nSET Price = 899.99 \nWHERE ProductID = 1;</code></pre><h3>Materialized View</h3><p>A Materialized View is fundamentally different from a regular View as it physically stores the query results in the database. This provides faster performance for complex queries but requires periodic refreshing.</p><table class=\"data-table\"><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Regular View</th><th>Materialized View</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>Stores only the query definition</td><td>Physically stores the query results</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance</strong></td><td>Query is executed on each call</td><td>Fast access to pre-computed data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Data Freshness</strong></td><td>Always reflects real-time changes</td><td>Requires periodic or manual refresh</td></tr></tbody></table><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Create a Materialized View (PostgreSQL syntax)\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW Monthly_Sales_Report AS\nSELECT \n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM OrderDate) AS Year,\n    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM OrderDate) AS Month,\n    COUNT(*) AS OrderCount,\n    SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalRevenue\nFROM Orders\nGROUP BY 1, 2;\n\n-- The view must be manually refreshed\nREFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW Monthly_Sales_Report;</code></pre><hr><h2>How to Create a View</h2><h3>The CREATE VIEW Statement with Practical Examples</h3><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Create a view for active customers\nCREATE VIEW Active_Customers AS\nSELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, Email, City\nFROM Customers\nWHERE IsActive = 1;\n\n-- A complex view with a JOIN and statistics\nCREATE VIEW Customer_Order_Summary AS\nSELECT \n    C.CustomerID,\n    C.CustomerName,\n    COUNT(O.OrderID) AS TotalOrders,\n    COALESCE(SUM(O.TotalAmount), 0) AS TotalSpent\nFROM Customers C\nLEFT JOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID\nWHERE C.IsActive = 1\nGROUP BY C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName;</code></pre><h3>Using the WITH CHECK OPTION</h3><p>The WITH CHECK OPTION ensures that any INSERT or UPDATE operation performed through the view adheres to the view's WHERE clause conditions, preventing the entry of invalid data.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>CREATE VIEW High_Value_Customers_Safe AS\nSELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, CreditLimit\nFROM Customers\nWHERE CreditLimit >= 10000\nWITH CHECK OPTION;\n\n-- Attempting to insert a customer with a credit limit below 10000 will fail\n-- INSERT INTO High_Value_Customers_Safe VALUES (5, 'New Customer', 5000);\n-- Error: WITH CHECK OPTION constraint violated</code></pre><h3>Updating a View with CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW</h3><p>This command allows you to modify the definition of an existing view without having to drop it first.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Product_Summary AS\nSELECT \n    ProductID, \n    ProductName, \n    Price,\n    CategoryID\nFROM Products\nWHERE IsActive = 1;</code></pre><hr><h2>Use Cases for Views</h2><h3>Reducing Complexity (Hiding JOINs or Subqueries)</h3><p>Instead of writing a complex JOIN query every time, you can create a View to simplify it.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>CREATE VIEW Complete_Order_Details AS\nSELECT \n    O.OrderID,\n    C.CustomerName,\n    P.ProductName,\n    OD.Quantity,\n    OD.UnitPrice\nFROM Customers C\nINNER JOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID\nINNER JOIN OrderDetails OD ON O.OrderID = OD.OrderID\nINNER JOIN Products P ON OD.ProductID = P.ProductID;\n\n-- Now, using it is simple\nSELECT * FROM Complete_Order_Details\nWHERE CustomerName = 'ABC Company';</code></pre><h3>Managing Permissions (Granting Partial Data Access)</h3><p>You can create a View that exposes only non-sensitive columns or rows belonging to a specific user, and then grant permissions on the View instead of the base table.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- A view for managers, showing only their own employees without sensitive data\nCREATE VIEW Manager_Employee_View AS\nSELECT \n    EmployeeID,\n    EmployeeName,\n    Position,\n    PerformanceRating\nFROM Employee_Records\nWHERE ManagerID = CURRENT_USER(); -- Syntax depends on the database system</code></pre><h3>Reusing Queries in an Organized Way</h3><p>You can create a library of base Views (e.g., active customers, valid orders) and then use them to build more complex analytical Views on top of them.</p><hr><h2>View vs. Table vs. CTE</h2><table class=\"data-table\"><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>View</th><th>Table</th><th>CTE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Virtual database object</td><td>Physical database object</td><td>Temporary expression in a query</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lifecycle</strong></td><td>Permanent until dropped</td><td>Permanent until dropped</td><td>Exists only for the query's duration</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reusability</strong></td><td>Across multiple queries</td><td>Across multiple queries</td><td>Only within the same query</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>When to use a View instead of a CTE</h3><p>Use a <strong>View</strong> when you need to reuse the same logic across multiple queries or want to apply a security layer. Use a <strong>CTE</strong> for breaking down a complex, single-use query or for handling recursive queries.</p><hr><h2>Best Practices</h2><ul><li><strong>Use Descriptive Names:</strong> Start your View name with a prefix like `vw_` or `v_` to distinguish it.</li><li><strong>Select Only Required Columns:</strong> Avoid using `SELECT *` in your View definition to improve performance.</li><li><strong>Avoid Excessive Nesting:</strong> Don't build Views on top of other Views for more than 2-3 levels to prevent performance issues.</li><li><strong>Index the Base Tables:</strong> The performance of a View directly depends on the performance of its underlying query, so ensure proper indexes are in place.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>SQL Views are a strategic tool for building maintainable, scalable, and secure database systems. Mastery comes with practice, a deep understanding of project requirements, and choosing the right type of View for each use case.</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Introduction: What is a CTE and Why is it Important?</h2><p>A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set, defined with a name within a WITH clause, that exists only within the scope of a single query. A CTE is like a temporary, virtual table that can be referenced by the main query, leading to cleaner, more readable, and more manageable queries for complex operations.</p><h3>Difference Between CTE, Subquery, and View</h3><ul><li><strong>Subquery:</strong> A query written inside a larger query, often fetching temporary data. It doesn't allow for easy reuse or a structured logical flow.</li><li><strong>View:</strong> A query stored in the database, usable across multiple queries. However, it has a fixed structure and requires privileges to create.</li><li><strong>CTE:</strong> Temporary, defined within a single query's scope using a WITH clause. It enables breaking down large queries into clear, understandable steps and is executed only once within that scope.</li></ul><h3>Why Use a CTE?</h3><ul><li>To improve the readability of complex queries.</li><li>To break down operations into clear, logical steps.</li><li>To be used within JOIN and Aggregate operations without repeating code.</li><li>To create recursive CTEs for handling hierarchical structures or iterative calculations.</li></ul><hr><h2>Basic Syntax</h2><h3>The WITH Clause</h3><p>The basic syntax for a CTE is as follows:</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH cte_name [ (column_1, column_2, ...) ] AS (\n    -- A SELECT statement that returns a temporary result set\n    SELECT ...\n)\nSELECT ... FROM cte_name;</code></pre><h3>Simple Example of a CTE with SELECT</h3><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH CustomersInCairo AS (\n    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName\n    FROM Customers\n    WHERE City = 'Cairo'\n)\nSELECT * FROM CustomersInCairo;</code></pre><p>Here, a temporary result set named CustomersInCairo is defined and then used in the main query.</p><hr><h2>Types of CTEs</h2><h3>Non-recursive CTE</h3><p>This is the basic type, a temporary query result that is used directly once in the query.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH HighSalaryEmployees AS (\n    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary\n    FROM Employees\n    WHERE Salary > 7000\n)\nSELECT * FROM HighSalaryEmployees;</code></pre><h3>Recursive CTE</h3><p>A recursive CTE allows the CTE to reference itself internally, typically for building sequences or hierarchies.</p><h4>Recursive Structure:</h4><ul><li><em>Anchor Member</em>: The initial base set of data.</li><li><em>Recursive Member</em>: An operation that joins the previous results with the next step.</li></ul><pre><code class='language-sql'>-- Example: Calculate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10\nWITH NumbersCTE (n) AS (\n    SELECT 1  -- Anchor\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT n + 1 FROM NumbersCTE WHERE n < 10  -- Recursive member\n)\nSELECT * FROM NumbersCTE;</code></pre><hr><h2>Practical Uses for CTEs</h2><h3>Simplifying Complex Queries</h3><p>Instead of using nested subqueries, you can define multiple CTEs to create sequential steps, making the query's logic easier to understand.</p><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH Sales2024 AS (\n    SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, TotalAmount\n    FROM Orders\n    WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2024\n),\nTopCustomers AS (\n    SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalPurchase\n    FROM Sales2024\n    GROUP BY CustomerID\n    HAVING SUM(TotalAmount) > 10000\n)\nSELECT * FROM TopCustomers;</code></pre><h3>Using a CTE with a JOIN</h3><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH RecentOrders AS (\n    SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate\n    FROM Orders\n    WHERE OrderDate > DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())\n)\nSELECT C.CustomerName, R.OrderDate\nFROM Customers C\nJOIN RecentOrders R ON C.CustomerID = R.CustomerID;</code></pre><h3>Using a CTE in INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE</h3><h4>INSERT:</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH NewCustomers AS (\n    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName\n    FROM ImportCustomers\n    WHERE IsVerified = 1\n)\nINSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, CustomerName)\nSELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM NewCustomers;</code></pre><h4>UPDATE:</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH UnderstockedProducts AS (\n    SELECT ProductID FROM Products WHERE StockQuantity < 5\n)\nUPDATE Products\nSET IsActive = 0\nWHERE ProductID IN (SELECT ProductID FROM UnderstockedProducts);</code></pre><h4>DELETE:</h4><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH ExpiredOrders AS (\n    SELECT OrderID FROM Orders WHERE Status = 'Expired'\n)\nDELETE FROM Orders\nWHERE OrderID IN (SELECT OrderID FROM ExpiredOrders);</code></pre><hr><h2>Recursive CTEs in Detail</h2><h3>Example of Hierarchical Data (Employee-Manager Tree):</h3><pre><code class='language-sql'>WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (\n    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, EmployeeName, 1 AS Level\n    FROM Employees\n    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL  -- Top-level managers\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.EmployeeName, eh.Level + 1\n    FROM Employees e\n    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID\n)\nSELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy\nORDER BY Level, EmployeeID;</code></pre><hr><h2>Comparison: CTE vs. Subquery vs. View</h2><table class=\"data-table\"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>CTE</th><th>Subquery</th><th>View</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>Temporary, within a query</td><td>Temporary, within a query</td><td>Permanent in the database</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reusability</strong></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Complexity</strong></td><td>Breaks down queries</td><td>Nested and sometimes unclear</td><td>Clear for repeated use</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Recursion Support</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>When to Use Each?</h3><ul><li><strong>CTE:</strong> To improve the clarity of a complex, single-use query, or when you need recursion (sequences/hierarchies).</li><li><strong>Subquery:</strong> For simple cases or when you need a direct inner query.</li><li><strong>View:</strong> For repeated use cases or to abstract complexity from the end-user.</li></ul><hr><h2>Best Practices</h2><ul><li><strong>Use Clear Names for CTEs:</strong> Choose names that describe the content and role of the CTE clearly.</li><li><strong>Avoid Excessive Nesting of CTEs:</strong> Use 1-3 levels at most and avoid defining multiple nested CTEs without a clear purpose.</li><li><strong>Pay Attention to Performance in Recursive CTEs:</strong> Add a clear termination condition to prevent infinite loops.</li></ul><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>CTEs in SQL are an advanced tool that helps developers write more organized and readable queries, especially for complex logic or hierarchical structures. When used according to best practices, analysis and development become faster and less error-prone.</p><p><strong>My advice to developers:</strong> Use CTEs as a tool to clarify logic and break down solutions. Remember that they are one of your most powerful weapons for building SQL queries that are easy to develop and maintain.</p>"
