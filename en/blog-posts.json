    "content": "<p>In the highly competitive world of e-commerce, success no longer depends on product quality alone, but on how well you understand your data. Data is the new oil, and its analysis is the key to sustainable growth. In this article, I will outline five practical and direct ways data analysis can help increase your e-commerce store's profits.</p><h2>1. Customer Segmentation</h2><p>Not all customers are the same. Using models like RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), you can segment your customers into strategic groups: Champions, Loyal Customers, At-Risk Customers, and others. This enables you to:</p><ul><li>Launch marketing campaigns tailored to each segment.</li><li>Offer exclusive deals to your most valuable customers to increase their loyalty.</li><li>Re-target inactive customers with irresistible offers.</li></ul><h2>2. Market Basket Analysis</h2><p>Ever wondered which products customers buy together? Market Basket Analysis answers this question. By understanding these relationships, you can:</p><ul><li>Display smart product recommendations ('You might also like...').</li><li>Create bundles and offers that increase the Average Order Value (AOV).</li><li>Optimize product page layouts to display related items.</li></ul><h2>3. Dynamic Pricing</h2><p>Instead of setting a fixed price, you can use data to dynamically adjust prices based on factors like demand, competitor pricing, time of day, and even user behavior. This doesn't always mean raising prices, but rather setting the optimal price that maximizes profit at any given moment.</p><h2>4. Inventory Forecasting</h2><p>Stockouts mean lost sales, and overstocking means tying up capital. Using historical sales data, you can build predictive models that forecast demand for each product, helping you manage your inventory efficiently and avoid both problems.</p><h2>5. Conversion Funnel Analysis</h2><p>Why do customers add products to the cart and then leave without purchasing? Analyzing the conversion funnel (from visiting the homepage to completing the payment) helps you identify weak points on your site. You might discover that the checkout process is complicated or that shipping costs are unclear. Fixing these issues can significantly increase your conversion rate.</p><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Data analysis is no longer a luxury but a necessity for the success of any e-commerce store. Starting to implement these strategies will give you a strong competitive edge and set you on the right path to achieving real, sustainable growth.</p><p><strong>Ready to get started? <a href='/en/contact/'>Contact me</a> to discuss how we can apply these solutions to your store.</strong></p>"

    "content": "<p>In the world of modern medicine, Artificial Intelligence and data analysis play a pivotal role in improving healthcare. One of the most important applications is heart disease prediction models, which help doctors detect the disease before it occurs. In this article, I'll explain in simple terms how a heart disease prediction model works.</p><h2>1. Collecting Medical Data</h2><p>The first step is to collect patient data from multiple sources, such as:</p><ul><li>Blood tests and cholesterol levels.</li><li>Blood pressure and heart rate.</li><li>Age, gender, and family history of heart disease.</li><li>Lifestyle (smoking, physical activity, diet).</li></ul><h2>2. Processing and Cleaning Data</h2><p>Medical data often contains missing or inaccurate information. Data analysts clean this data, remove outliers, and convert it into a format usable for statistical models or machine learning algorithms.</p><h2>3. Choosing the Right Algorithm</h2><p>Several algorithms can be used, such as:</p><ul><li>Logistic Regression.</li><li>Decision Trees.</li><li>Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.</li><li>Artificial Neural Networks for more complex cases.</li></ul><h2>4. Training the Model</h2><p>The data is split into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The model learns from the training data the relationship between health factors and the probability of developing heart disease.</p><h2>5. Prediction and Performance Evaluation</h2><p>After training, the model is used to make predictions on new data. Its accuracy is then evaluated using metrics like:</p><ul><li>Accuracy.</li><li>F1-Score.</li><li>ROC Curve and AUC.</li></ul><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>A heart disease prediction model is a powerful tool that aids in early prevention and improves treatment outcomes. Its success depends on the quality of the data and the precision of its design. Using these models can save lives and reduce healthcare costs.</p><p><strong>Interested in how we can build a custom model for you or your medical institution? <a href='/en/contact/'>Contact me</a> to get started.</strong></p>"

    "content": "<p>Often, as developers, we need to display data in a way that is natural and easy for users to understand. For example, instead of showing a file size as a large number like '15042934' bytes, it's better to display it as '14.3 MB'. This is where the <strong>Humanize</strong> library in Python comes in.</p><p>The Humanize library is a simple and effective tool for converting technical data (like numbers, dates, and sizes) into a human-readable format. In this article, we will review the most important functions of this library and how to use them.</p><h2>1. Installation</h2><p>Before you start, you must install the library. You can do this easily using 'pip':</p><pre><code class='language-bash'>pip install humanize</code></pre><h2>2. Formatting Large Numbers (intcomma)</h2><p>The <code>intcomma</code> function helps add thousand separators to large numbers, making them easier to read.</p><pre><code class='language-python'>import humanize\n\nnumber = 1234567\n\n# Without the library\nprint(f'Original number: {number}')\n\n# Using humanize.intcomma\nprint(f'Formatted number: {humanize.intcomma(number)}')</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>Original number: 1234567\nFormatted number: 1,234,567</code></pre><h2>3. Converting Numbers to Words (intword)</h2><p>The <code>intword</code> function converts very large numbers into a shortened format using words like 'million' or 'billion'.</p><pre><code class='language-python'>import humanize\n\nlarge_number = 1560000000\nsmall_number = 85000\n\nprint(f'Large number: {humanize.intword(large_number)}')\nprint(f'Small number: {humanize.intword(small_number)}')</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>Large number: 1.6 billion\nSmall number: 85.0 thousand</code></pre><h2>4. Displaying Relative Dates (naturalday and naturaltime)</h2><p>This is one of the library's most powerful features. It allows you to display the time difference between a specific date and the current time naturally.</p><ul><li><code>naturalday</code>: Displays the day relative to the current day (e.g., today, yesterday, tomorrow).</li><li><code>naturaltime</code>: Displays the time difference precisely (e.g., 5 minutes ago, in 2 hours).</li></ul><pre><code class='language-python'>import humanize\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nnow = datetime.now()\nyesterday = now - timedelta(days=1)\nfive_minutes_ago = now - timedelta(minutes=5)\n\nprint(f'Day display: {humanize.naturalday(yesterday)}')\nprint(f'Time display: {humanize.naturaltime(five_minutes_ago)}')</code></pre><p><strong>Output (will vary based on runtime):</strong></p><pre><code>Day display: yesterday\nTime display: 5 minutes ago</code></pre><h2>5. Formatting File Sizes (naturalsize)</h2><p>This function is very useful when dealing with file sizes. It converts a byte count into an understandable format (KB, MB, GB).</p><pre><code class='language-python'>import humanize\n\nfile_size_bytes = 14784512\n\nprint(f'File size: {humanize.naturalsize(file_size_bytes)}')\n\n# You can control the format (e.g., use the binary system)\nprint(f'File size (binary): {humanize.naturalsize(file_size_bytes, binary=True)}')</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>File size: 14.8 MB\nFile size (binary): 14.1 MiB</code></pre><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The Humanize library is an indispensable tool for any Python developer who wants to improve the user experience of their applications. With just a few lines of code, you can transform complex data into simple, elegant text that makes your application more professional and user-friendly.</p><p><strong>Want to explore other useful Python libraries? <a href='/en/blog/'>Browse the other articles</a> on the blog.</strong></p>"

  "content": "<h2>1. Query Mechanics</h2><p>Before executing any query, a connection to the MySQL server must be established. This process involves verifying the username and password, ensuring the server is running, and that the client application has the necessary permissions. Once the connection is established, queries can be sent for execution.</p><p>The basic steps for query execution are:</p><ul><li><strong>Connecting to the Server:</strong> Each connection to a MySQL server is identified by a unique ID upon first connection.</li><li><strong>Permission Check:</strong> The user must have permissions to execute the query and access the required data.</li><li><strong>Syntax Check:</strong> The query parser ensures the syntax is correct before execution.</li><li><strong>Query Optimizer:</strong> Responsible for determining the most efficient way to execute the query, deciding the order of table joins, selecting appropriate indexes, and creating an execution plan.</li><li><strong>Result Set:</strong> Once the query is executed, the results are returned in a table format containing the requested columns and rows.</li></ul><h2>2. The SELECT Clause</h2><p>This is the most important clause in SQL queries, as it specifies the columns to be displayed in the results.</p><ul><li>Select all columns using <code>*</code>.</li><li>Select specific columns by listing their names, separated by commas.</li><li>Add literal values, numbers, or strings.</li><li>Use mathematical expressions or built-in functions.</li><li>Add user-defined functions.</li><li>Assign aliases to columns using <code>AS</code> to improve clarity.</li><li>Remove duplicates using <code>DISTINCT</code>.</li></ul><h2>3. The FROM Clause</h2><p>Specifies the tables from which data is retrieved.</p><ul><li><strong>Permanent Tables:</strong> Created using <code>CREATE TABLE</code> and remain in the database.</li><li><strong>Derived Tables:</strong> Result from a subquery and are stored in memory.</li><li><strong>Temporary Tables:</strong> Store data temporarily and disappear at the end of the session.</li><li><strong>Views:</strong> Stored queries that act as virtual tables with no actual data.</li><li><strong>JOINs:</strong> Merge rows from multiple tables based on a common column.</li><li><strong>Table Aliases:</strong> To simplify queries, especially when joining multiple tables.</li></ul><h2>4. The WHERE Clause</h2><p>Used to filter rows based on specific conditions.</p><ul><li>Direct filtering of rows.</li><li>Using logical operators <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> to combine conditions.</li><li>Creating complex conditions using parentheses.</li></ul><h2>5. Grouping and Aggregation (GROUP BY & HAVING)</h2><p><code>GROUP BY</code> combines rows that have identical values in one or more columns, often used with aggregate functions like <code>COUNT()</code>, <code>SUM()</code>, and <code>AVG()</code>.</p><ul><li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> To analyze data within groups rather than individual rows.</li><li><strong>HAVING:</strong> To filter the resulting groups after aggregation, unlike WHERE, which operates on individual rows.</li></ul><h2>6. The ORDER BY Clause</h2><p>Used to sort the results in ascending (<code>ASC</code>) or descending (<code>DESC</code>) order.</p><ul><li>Specify sorting order by one or more columns.</li><li>Ability to sort by multiple columns.</li><li>Sorting using expressions or functions.</li></ul><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Mastering these clauses gives you the ability to write clearer and more efficient SQL queries, making data analysis and result extraction more accurate.</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Introduction: When Code Isn't Enough</h2><p>Every developer knows the feeling: after weeks of hard work, building complex algorithms, and solving tough problems, the project is finally ready. The code runs efficiently, and the results are fantastic. But when you upload it to GitHub, you write a simple title, a few lines in the README, and call it a day.</p><p>Herein lies the problem. <strong>A brilliant project with a weak README is like a masterpiece hidden in a dark basement; its value exists, but no one can see it.</strong> A README is not just documentation; it's your project's landing page, its marketer, and its tour guide. It's the bridge that connects your complex technical work to the outside world.</p><h2>Why Do Most Developers Write Bad READMEs?</h2><p>The reason is simple: we focus on 'how' the code works and forget to explain 'why' it matters. A good README doesn't just speak to other developers; it also speaks to:</p><ul><li><strong>Recruiters:</strong> Who want to understand the business value of your project in 30 seconds.</li><li><strong>Potential Collaborators:</strong> Who need to know the project's structure and how they can contribute.</li><li><strong>'Future You':</strong> Who will return to the project in 6 months and need to remember the reasoning behind every decision made.</li></ul><h2>The Solution: A Strategic Prompt to Build Your Project's Story</h2><p>To help you build this bridge, I've created a prompt designed to be a 'roadmap' for writing a professional README. This prompt doesn't just ask you to fill in the blanks; it forces you to think about your project from a strategic perspective.</p><h3>The Ultimate Prompt</h3><blockquote><p>You are an expert technical writer specializing in software project documentation. Your task is to write a README file for a software project in a clear, professional, and comprehensive manner. The file should be designed to be understood by a diverse audience, including developers, hiring managers, and non-technical stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Required README Elements:</strong></p><p><strong>Fundamentals:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Title:</strong> An engaging and descriptive title for the project.</li><li><strong>Table of Contents:</strong> For easy navigation.</li><li><strong>Project Description:</strong> A brief overview of the project and its main objectives.</li><li><strong>Problem It Solves:</strong> Clearly explain what problem or gap this project addresses.</li></ol><p><strong>Technical Details:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Tech Stack & Rationale:</b> A list of technologies, tools, and libraries used, with a brief explanation for choosing each one.</li><li><strong>The Process:</strong> Describe the main steps the project went through, from data collection (if any) to building the model or application. Describe important engineering decisions you made.</li><li><strong>Getting Started:</strong> A clear, step-by-step guide on how to install and run the project locally.</li></ol><p><strong>The Storytelling Layer:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Motivation:</strong> What inspired you to work on this specific problem?</li><li><strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong> Mention 1-2 major technical challenges you faced and how you overcame them. This demonstrates your problem-solving abilities.</li><li><strong>Outcomes & Impact:</strong> What does the final product look like? What are the key results of the analysis or the capabilities of the application?</li><li><strong>Limitations & Future Work:</strong> Acknowledge any known limitations in the project and the ideas you have for future development. This shows integrity and strategic thinking.</li><li><strong>Intended Use:</strong> Who is the target audience for this project? How can they benefit from it?</li><li><strong>Credits & License:</strong> Acknowledge any data sources or code you used, and specify the license type.</li></ol></blockquote><h3>How to Use the Prompt Effectively</h3><ol><li><strong>Gather Your Information First:</strong> Before using the prompt, prepare brief points for each of the required elements for your project.</li><li><strong>Start the Conversation with AI:</strong> Copy the prompt, then provide the project information you prepared.</li><li><strong>Treat it as a First Draft:</strong> The output you get from the AI tool is an excellent draft, not the final version. Review it, add your personal touch, and correct any details to reflect your true voice and expertise.</li></ol><hr><h3>Conclusion: Invest in Your Project's Front Page</h3><p>A professional README is not a luxury; it is a direct investment in your personal brand as a developer. It transforms your repository from a mere code archive into a living portfolio that tells the story of your skills and your ability to deliver results.</p>"
